                            OF CONTENT</h3>
                        <p>Sites must not
                            contain Warez, copyright or other illegal material including links or
                            redirects to copyright material hosted on 3rd party websites /
                            resources. The onus is on you the customer to prove that you own the
                            rights to publish material, not for IFastNet to prove that you do
                            not. IFastNet does not allow the propagation or distribution of
                            copyright material, files or warez under any circumstances.</p>
                        <h3>ACCEPTABLE SERVER RESOURCE USE</h3>
                        <p>Sites must not use
                            excessive amounts of server resources. These include bandwidth,
                            processor utilization and / or disk space. Please see the 'High
                            Resource Use Policy' in the General Terms and Conditions.</p>
                        <h3>SCRIPT USAGE TERMS</h3>
                        <p>Scripts on the site
                            must be designed to produce web-based content, and not to use the
                            server as an application server. Using the server to generate large
                            volumes of email from a database is an example of activity that is
                            not allowed. Scripts should not attempt to manipulate the timeouts on
                            servers. These are set at the present values to ensure the
                            reliability of the server. Sites that reset these do so because they
                            are resource intensive, and adversely affect server performance and
                            are therefore not allowed. Scripts that are designed to provide proxy
                            services, anonymous or otherwise, are not allowed.</p>

                        <p>The primary purpose
                            of any script must be to produce a web page. Scripts that send a
                            single email based upon user entered information, or update a
                            database are acceptable. Scripts that send bulk email or perform
                            processor intensive database processes are not allowed. All outgoing
                            mail is monitored and filtered and must be sent to or from a IFastNet
                            -hosted domain.</p>
                        <p>Sites must not
                            contain scripts that attempt to access privileged server resources,
                            or other sites on the same server</p>
                        <h3>USAGE OF DISK SPACE TERMS</h3>
                        <p>IFastNet offers
                            large web space and bandwidth with hosting accounts. By this, we mean
                            space for legitimate web site content and bandwidth for visitors to
                            view it. All files on a domain must be part of the active website and
                            linked to the site. Sites should not contain any backups, downloads,
                            or other non-web based content. We will treat all password protected
                            archive (e.g. zip and rar) files as unacceptable. Multimedia content
                            such as audio and video is acceptable provided it is streamed to the
                            user, links to HTTP download of this content is not acceptable.</p>

                        <p>On unlimited disk
                            space plans we offer quotaless disk space access, however the disks
                            in servers are not unlimited so you may become limited if a hard
                            drive begins to fill to capacity.</p>
                        <p>INODE USAGE</p>

                        <p>In computing, an
                            inode is a data structure on a traditional Unix-style file system
                            such as UFS. An inode stores basic information about a regular file,
                            directory, or other file system object.</p>
                        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inode">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inode</a></p>

                        <p>IFastNet reserves
                            the right to limit INODEs usage on premium hosting plans to 380000 on starter premium plan, 840000 on super and ultimate premium plans, and unlimited inodes on Business hosting plans subject to acceptable
                            usage.</p>
                        <h3>RIGHT TO SUSPEND / TERMINATE HOSTING SERVICES</h3>
                        <p>You acknowledge that

                            available via the Service. Without limiting the foregoing, IFastNet
                            and its designees shall have the right to remove any Content that
                            violates the TOS or is otherwise objectionable. You agree that you

                        <p>When you register
                            with IFastNet , you acknowledge that in using IFastNet services to
                            send electronic communications (including but not limited to email,
                            uploading photos and files and other Internet activities), you will

                            domain names we register. If requested, IFastNet will allow the
                            'transfer' any free domains to an alternative hosting provider if a
                            transfer administration fee is paid, which amounts to $29.99. If the
                            service has been provisioned for over 12 months or sooner IFastNet
                            may waiver the above mentioned transfer fee. IFastNet reserves the
                            right to cancel / transfer domain names which are provided with paid
                            hosting accounts. We reserve the right to renew or allow the

                            providing the free domain name will be minused from the refund
                            amounts (this could sometimes lead to a negative value). The .INFO
                            domain name provided with the 'monthly standard' premium plan is free
                            for the 1st year only, to keep the domain after the 1st year, a
                            renewal fee needs to be paid. (This is a separate additional payment
                            to the monthly payments for the hosting) To renew the INFO domain
                            name, we require a payment of $11.00 USD to cover the cost of
                            renewing the domain with the registrars.</p>
                        <p>The free domain

                            payments over the year.</p>

                        <p>You are not allowed

                            been made (2 x $6.99). We reserve the right to suspend any free
                            domain name associated with a monthly ultimate account which has not
                            been paid for 2 complete months.</p>
